# Reflection

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

## Required

### What requirements did you achieve?

I implemented state and use effect I completed functionality of the page, when the user clicks on a thumbnail a full screen is displayed, my images have alt text and I used “.map” to display images there’s a “prev button” and “next button“ to navigate between images in the thumbnail container.

### Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

However the Keyboard navigation was incomplete

### If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I ran out of time trying fix it unfortunately, I had to focus on the core functionality of the project

## Optional

Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

### Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

- Any feedback regarding the project is welcome, specifically how to create a functioning "keyboard navigation"

### What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

- External sources I used: (Youtube - duck://player/Vc6SFpPf-V4, duck://player/SK9AlIbexOE). Articles I used: (https://manikandan-b.medium.com/react-functional-component-lifecycle-e8525f8fadea), (https://dev.to/ranewallin/this-simple-math-hack-lets-you-create-an-image-carousel-without-any-if-statements-5chj).

### What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

- There were some errors with my initial logic but this was resolved after I identified some incomplete and misplaced syntax. One of those issues was my ".env file" not being setup properly, which i was able to quickly resolve.

### What went really well and what could have gone better?
